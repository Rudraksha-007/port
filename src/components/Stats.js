        <p>
        To date, I’ve solved around 220 problems on LeetCode, participated in 5 LeetCode contests with a rating of 1416, and successfully completed the GFG DSA course.
I hold the rank of 21 in GFG of our campus (all years)
I’ve also earned multiple Google Cloud certifications and completed freeCodeCamp’s 300-hour certification in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design. As part of my commitment to mastering web development, I am actively tackling the LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge to sharpen my skills further.

In addition to this, I have hands-on experience with Unity and C# for game development, and I’m well-versed in Linux. I’ve also delved into the technical depths of compiling AOSP-based custom ROMs, showcasing my passion for understanding and customizing systems at their core.
